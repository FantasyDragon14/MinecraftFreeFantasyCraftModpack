The signals and trains are updated in (practically) real time.\n\n![Example track map](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gxoNIjg6/images/8aa58af4ca9cc459a84ce492770a92e358cd2714.gif)\n\n# Usage\n\nCTM is available for [download on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-track-map). **Please make sure you download the correct version for your loader, Minecraft version, and Create version.** Below is the compatibility chart for Create versions:\n\n| | CTM ≤1.3 | CTM 1.4 | CTM ≥1.5 |\n|:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n| **Create 0.5.0** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |\n| **Create 0.5.1** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |\n\n## Installation\nSimply place the .jar file in your mods folder (or install with a modloader) like any other mod! CTM is intended to be a server side mod, but can also run in single-player worlds and LAN servers. It runs a web server on port `3876` by default, but [this can be configured](#configuration). You must forward this port if you wish to see the map. *[(How do I do this?)](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+I+port+forward)* \n\nThe map itself is visible at the root (by default `http://localhost:3876/`). If using a proxy to serve the map, make sure to configure it to let Server-Sent Events through.\n\n### *Singleplayer*\nThe map is hosted on your computer so while Minecraft is open, enter `http://localhost:3876/` into your browser.\n\n### *Multiplayer*\n\n **A) Local (LAN) server**\\\nThe map is still hosted on your computer so while the game is open, enter `http://localhost:3876/` into your browser.\\\nThose in your household can see the map by entering `http://[your computer's IPV4 address]:3876/` into their browser.\\\n*[How do I see my computer's IPV4 address?](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+do+i+see+my+local+ipv4+address)*\n\n**B) The server is on my PC**\\\nThe map is still hosted on your computer so while the server is open,  enter `http://localhost:3876/` into your browser.\\\nThose in your household can see the map by entering `http://[your computer's IPV4 address]:3876/` into their browser.\\\nThose outside your household can see the map by entering `http://[your public IPV4 address]:3876/` into their browser.\\\n*[How do I see my public IPV4 address?](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+my+public+ipv4+address)*\n\n**C) The server is hosted with a hosting service**\\\nThe map is hosted with the server on that service. You can see the map at `[your server address]:3876/` while the server is up.\\\n**NOTE: YOUR SERVICE MUST SUPPORT EXTRA PORT FORWARDING.** You can check with support/the docs for the service or just good old Google. If the service doesn't support this, you are out of luck. You can switch services or try hosting your own.\n\n*Just so it's clear: Do not include the brackets around your IPV4 address! For example: `192.168.0.0:3876`*\n\n## READ THIS BEFORE ASKING FOR HELP!\n\nTo use this mod, **you must be able to open a second port**, in addition to your Minecraft server, which CTM will run its web server on. If you are using Aternos, this is not possible. If you are using a shared hosting provider, please contact your host for assistance in opening a port. No support will be provided to open a port or to diagnose issues which are not caused by a bug in the mod.\n\n# Advanced Usage\n\n### CTM API\nCTM provides the following API, also accessible through the same port:\n\n- `/api/network`, `/api/network.rt`: List of all track pieces and train stations\n- `/api/signals`, `/api/signals.rt`: List of all train signals, including their states\n  (green, yellow, red)\n- `/api/blocks`, `/api/blocks.rt`: List of all signal control blocks, and whether they are occupied or reserved by a train\n- `/api/trains`, `/api/trains.rt`: List of all assembled trains, including their names and\n  positions\n- `/api/style.css`: CSS style sheet generated from configured colors and fonts\n- `/api/config.json`: Map configuration\n\nThe `.rt` versions update in real time with Server-Sent Events (SSE).\n\n### Configuration\n\nCTM's config options can be found at `create-track-map.json` in your server's config directory. It is automatically created at startup if it doesn't exist.\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n```js\n{\n  // Whether to actually start the watcher and the server.\n  \"enable\": false,\n\n  // How long to wait between track data updates.\n  \"watch_interval_seconds\": 0.5,\n  // The port the internal web server listens on.\n  \"server_port\": 3876,\n\n  \"map_style\": {\n    // Font to use for the map's UI.

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Xaero's World Map mod adds a self-writing fullscreen map to your Minecraft client. Works as a separate mod but is a lot better with Xaero's Minimap. The reason why it's available separately is to keep Xaero's Minimap as light-weight as possible. <strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n<p>The mod is still in development! Please report any bugs that you encounter or otherwise they probably won't get fixed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure your world is optimized (<em>Singleplayer - Edit - Optimize World</em>) for the Minecraft version you're playing (repeat after every Minecraft update). It takes A LOT longer to generate singleplayer maps from unoptimized world saves.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">patreon.com/xaero96</span></a>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li>A self-writing world map (as opposed to manual paper maps).

In the waypoint menu, you can see a list of all your map waypoints from the rendered sets, interact with them with the mouse cursor, filter them by name in a text field. The menu also lets you toggle the visibility of disabled waypoints, toggle rendering all sets and change the current waypoint set. Hovering over the waypoints in the menu also acts as hovering over them on the map: they are highlighted on the map and you can use the right-click or hover controls to interact with them.</li>\n<li>An option to export a map as a PNG image file. The mod tries to export the whole map, so it might not work, if the map is millions of blocks in length. I'm planning to give more options for exporting the map in the future!</li>\n<li>Option to limit your map access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add&nbsp;<em>mapItemId:minecraft:compass&nbsp;</em>anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the map will not work unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; text-decoration: underline;\">Get Xaero's Minimap</span></a></p>\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?\n\n<p>First, exit the server and locate the Minecraft game directory that you're using to play on the server. In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, there is no official way to do that. Copying cache from a singleplayer map will not work.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page. It should cover most cases. Contact me, if it doesn't help.</p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have the minimap installed, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p>(requires minimap to work)&nbsp;<strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart. Do the same for the minimap mod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

This mod adds a hand full of peripherals that allow futher access to Creates features.\n\n## Content\n> 👉 _**Create** now actually has native support for **CC: Tweaked** too! But why stop there?_\n\n- **Two essential blocks of this mod are the `Source Block` and `Target Block`.**\nThey simulate a source or target, making it possible to comunicate within every other source/target that **Create** provides.\n\n- Another block that can come in very handy is the `RedRouter Block`.\nIt can send or receive redstone signals without having to worry about wireless channels or by using multible Computers, using the Redstone API.\n\n- This mod also adds some smaller, fun things like the `Scroller Pane` or `Animatronic`. The Scroller Pane lets you select a number and send it to a Computer using **Creates** interface, while the Animatronic is a puppet you can [control and animate as you like!](https://youtu.be/MI_tHMHrAY0)\n\n### Psst, hey! Why don't you check out the gallery as well?\n\n## Tutorials\n_But how do I use the peripherals?_ Good question!

Some features may be changed in current and future versions.\n2. Will not port features after fabric-version 3.0.2, because the original project owner changed the license to All Right Reserved after that version.\n\n\n\n## 🍺Why refill?\nReasons are simple:\n* New ways to interact (e.g. Place Beer in Bartending Table and you'll see it)\n* (Partial) Automation support by implementing Capability (e.g. All autiomation using item trasnfer things such as Hopper. For more infomation please check \"How to ...?\" Section)\n* Extension and Compat With Other Mods (e.g. Keg support Alcocraft Recipe This is now suspended since alcocraft 1.19.2 crash problem, See issue Alcocraft#10）\n\n## 🍺How to...?\n### Brewing:\n1.Prepare a keg and at least 4 empty beer mugs, open the brewing menu by right clicking on the keg block.  \n2.Put ingredients into keg(the order of materials does not matter，e.g.，swapping the positions of apples and wheat in the gif below gets the same beer result).  \n3.Once you decide which beer to brew,  put mugs in and start brewing.  \n4. ...Brewing...  \n5.Down the hatch!  \n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/RZwVw5iA/images/9748ab94beec22cb6454c068325a41495e1be3fe.gif)\nAutomation support: beer can be exported.  \n \n\n### Bartering:\nBarter items with residents from different places through bartering box, obtain unique spices for bartending!\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/RZwVw5iA/images/7520ee9d69a04010158e3d8d506c8535b8a9d8c2.png)\nAutomation support: not implemented yet.  \n\n### Bartending:\nRight-click on the bartending table with beer in hand.  Place your beer on bartending and then put spices in! Discover hidden flavor combinations!  \nAutomation support: Beer and spice can be imported, and once a spice is added into beer, the beer will be able to be exported.\n\n## 🍺Credit:\nThank following people for their amazing ground works!  \nLekavar and MarbleGateKeeper made 1.17.1 and previous official versions.  \nNaetheline made 1.18.1 version and ported bartending & bartering features.  \nyanang007 made 1.18.2 version.  \nMarbleGateKeeper made JEI plugin.  \nyanang007 made Jade integration.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the <strong>aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft</strong>, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen.

For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets.

The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\".

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode and/or entity radar on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder).

In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining.

that aims to transform how terrain is shaped.\n\n## Features\n\n### Mountain Ranges\n\nThe way mountains generate has been completely overhauled, with them forming huge mountain ranges that can stretch for thousands of blocks. These can stretch higher than vanilla mountains do, sometimes reaching peaks above y300!\n\n### Underground Rivers\n\nIn mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers.  Very deep underground, you can even find a deeper variant with lava instead of water.\n\n### Oceanside Cliffs\n\nOn steep cliff faces in the Stony Shore biome, waves and wind carve into the cliff. (Disclaimer: waves and wind not included.)\n\n### Smoother Surfaces\n\nOne of (if not the most) notable changes to generation you'll see with Tectonic is that terrain is much smoother than normal. This means the strange staircasing on some hills - also referred to as \"lerp\" issues - is gone. In previous Tectonic versions this meant that Windswept biomes were removed from generation, but in v2 and above they will once again generate.\n\n### Dunes\n\nSmooth desert dunes will generate in some Desert biomes, giving Deserts a special look to them.\n\n### Deeper Oceans\n\nOceans are much deeper than they are in vanilla, with deep oceans even extending into the deepslate layer!\n\n-----\n\n### Removed Features\n\nPrevious versions of Tectonic included things like custom biomes, trees, and more. These were removed for both performance and compatibility reasons. For improved biome vegetation, check out [Not Just Biomes](https://modrinth.com/mod/not-just-biomes).\n","published":"2022-10-06T04:20:33.396078Z","updated":"2023-12-10T00:12:13.622459Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":184080,"followers":1181,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4","22w42a","23w03a","23w04a"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["eU3jwc8i","etznjsos","FwjITjTl","hnsJhfYa","5GAlwGt0","VrJPesuB","E5XyYJFU","PXOM0Pjv","WHCoQSwq","tv7QYqaD","YpYTfu5q","b9YiEZG5","hexdXndT","LfqeFzal","Sk2Wj54u","jEweyNSr","8DvETEcQ","kyOyZ959","CrJgVhRz","4FmsVRER","o79iZuLn","nCfuFGUJ","kD3ERzAU","YQW6UEha","iXsm0qYv","Xp7KZG02","31L9TtHa","IKoGJPng","VUDM6p8V","ikU2p37z","E1Z5e43T","T8MN0KIq","kBneO6ki","q8U9JFXx","5xZAjOFp","RffiLNDg","sJqpHn8g","iUOBzhHD","VUseyTDe","TROmHrN8","zTGbIDfc","NqBsgux4","9tb4XPoV","xH89dtCn","tx6rLdUA","xmaHuY49","5TxvYf3R","N2QHzPke","65V8fhDb","mBxJOCQy","yqPldUFz","1yngXVi8","9Vv7T6db","RGkQIH1q","rnuM9oqV","xLL0P4rp","VLm89jvQ","gO9d3ZPd","VpCClpZj","jNMP7968","TO90bMp9","gY8cl3L6","y3NXGAQL","8Efuao80","Ojy7D0Vt","xGrrU4rl","H2lfq68F","aZXeWJ3r","clI4wc2M","ZiVAiJjF","i48vQzPC","DRRt4Y5n","ynecO9fz","IFpAp5hn","jQaYKWuK","LhqG2XwP"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/b7bba8989ecdc3f1216aeb823a5bcc6b9098000d.png"},"version":{"id":"aZXeWJ3r","project_id":"lWDHr9jE","author_id":"MllXIwZc","featured":false,"name":"v2.1.1 ~ 1.19.3-1.20.1","version_number":"2.1.1","changelog":"- All Tectonic cave changes have been reverted back to vanilla excluding lava rivers.\n- Fixed compatibility issues with the Continents pack.\n- Fixed several generation issues surrounding the Large Biomes world type, which includes a change to how continents are placed. **Existing worlds with Large Biomes will have chunk borders as a result of this**.

This is useful for modpacks that want to advertise themselves, or for people who simply want a nicer way to show that they are playing Minecraft. \n\nThis mod works out of the box, but you can customize it to suit your needs. Please refer to the WIKI above for more info\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_config.jpg)\n\nHate editing config files by hand? Why not try out the simple to use, [Config Editor App](https://srpcupdater.hypherionmc.me/) designed for Simple RPC. This app allows you to edit the config file step by step and even includes a Preview to show you what your Rich Presence will look like.\n\nThis app is available on Windows, Linux and Mac. You can download it from [HERE](https://srpcupdater.hypherionmc.me/)\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_help.jpg)\n\nYou can always refer to the [WIKI](https://srpc.fdd-docs.com) for help, but while I try to keep everything as simple as possible and keep the docs as useful as possible, sometimes things go wrong or it just doesn't make any sense. \n\nYou are more than welcome to open an Issue on Github if it's a bug or suggestion, or for quicker support, you can join our discord and ask your question in the appropriate channel\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_perms.jpg)\n\nIf it wasn't clear from the description, you are allowed to use this mod in your modpack.

Hydration is more relevant than temperature, so building your base in wet biomes is more advisable than doing so in cold ones.\nThis system is also compatible with **Cold Sweat**, and will use their more precise temperature calculations if the mod is present in the pack.  \n\n### 🍖 Farmer's Delight & Co.  \n\nThe stack size for **water bottles** has been increased to **64**, to make them fit with the foods from Farmer's Delight.\nEvery food item that should quench your thirst added by farmer's delight, respite, and brewin and chewin' is integrated by default, making teas (or booze) the **best late-game hydration source**.  \n\n### ⚙ Create\n\nA new block is added if you have Create installed: the **Sand Filter**, which can purify water fed to it by pipes.  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UdIApb3.png)  \n\n### 💧 Apple Skin  \n\nThe mod is compatible with apple skin, showing the \"quenched\" overlay if the mod is present, as well as tooltips for every item that quenches your thirst.  \n\n![](https://imgur.com/pbqR6Ea.png)\n\n##### To learn more about the mod, you can check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/ghen-git/Thirst-Mod/wiki) or the [Discord](https://discord.gg/wqfgcZCfYh)\n\n##### This mod is still very early in development, which means it's filled to the brim with bugs and glitches.

Adds an option to choose the crafting result if more than one is available.","body":"Polymorph is a mod that solves recipe conflicts by letting players choose between all potential\noutputs shared by the same ingredients.\n\nWith a sufficiently large amount of mods, recipe conflicts are a common occurrence and the\nresponsibility for resolving these usually falls on the user or modpack developer, using datapacks\nor other tools to ensure that each recipe is unique.\n\nPolymorph offers an alternative solution, allowing all possible crafting and smelting recipes to\nco-exist regardless of conflicts.\n\n## Features\n\n### Crafting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TkWswkG/polymorph.gif)\n\nWhen a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output\nslot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the\ncrafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients\ndon't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.\n\n### Smelting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QX9MNYM/polymorph-furnacedemo.gif)\n\nWhen a valid input matches more than one output, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder.

It also gives server owners powerful controls over their players' usage of the mod's features.\n\nThe mod's API allows other mods or plugins to easily interact with the parties and the chunk claims, both on the server and the client side. The mod already integrates with [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and [World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) mods. Make sure to update them to the latest versions.\n\nThe API of the mod allows the implementation of player permission systems to be used by the mod for some permission nodes (e.g. for having rank-based claim limits), with Prometheus, FTB Ranks, LuckPerms and the Forge/Fabric permission APIs having built-in support. It also allows the implementation of party systems to be used by claims alongside or instead of the default party system, with Argonauts and FTB Teams having built-in support. The default party system or claims can be disabled completely in the main config file.\n\n## Commands:\n/openpac ... - player config commands\n\n/openpac-claims ... - everything claim-related\n\n/openpac-parties ... - everything party-related\n\n/opm - shortcut for the party chat\n\n## Key Bindings:\n' - open the mod UI. Can be changed in the controls menu.\n\n## Configs:\n[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml - the main mod config. Make sure to shut down the server before editing it, or the server might overwrite all your changes.\n\n[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-... - some global \"player configs\", although all of them can be accessed in game through the UI\n\n## FAQ\n### 1) How do I configure the mod on my server?\nThe mod is mainly configured through the main config file at _[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_, or sometimes _[server directory]/config/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_ on Fabric/Quilt, while the server isn't running. Server claim, expired claim and wilderness configs, as well as the default player config, can be edited by OPs in-game with the UI (check your key bindings). Normal players can configure their own player config with the same UI. If the mod isn't installed on the client side, then you can use the player config chat commands instead.\n\n### 2) How do I use this mod as a regular player?\nMost things related to claims can be accessed with the in-game UI (check your key bindings). If you have the Xaero's World Map mod installed, you can view and edit your claims on the map screen as well, by right-clicking on the map or dragging with the right mouse button to make a selection. You can also use chat commands to make/edit claims. Parties can only be created and managed through chat commands at the moment.\n\n### 3) Why are some options greyed out in my player config?\nThe server admin/owner can configure with the main config file option _playerConfigurablePlayerConfigOptions_ which specific options players have access to. Everything else uses the value in the default player config.\n\n### 4) How do I disable all protection on my server?\nIn the server claim, expired claim and wilderness configs, as well as the default player config, disable the main protection option. Next, edit the config file _[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_, while the server isn't running. Remove the main option _claims.protectClaimedChunks_ from _playerConfigurablePlayerConfigOptions_.\n\n## Supported Mods:\nA lot of (usually smaller) mods should be supported by the claimed chunk protection automatically. Some mods go above and beyond with the mechanics they add to the game or modify, in which case chunk protection is not guaranteed and should be manually added, either to this mod or with an additional one. Feel free to leave suggestions on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/thexaero/open-parties-and-claims/issues) for the mods that you'd like to be supported. Please make sure that they are not already by testing it and provide an example of chunk griefing one can achieve with the mod.\n\nExplicitly supported mods:\n\n* (Since b0.8.0) Create - built into

](https://github.com/FiguraMC/Figura/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n\n# FAQ\n\n### • My avatars don't appear in the Figura list, even though they're in the correct folder?\n> Check if your avatar has a file called \"avatar.json\" (don't forget to check file extensions)\n> \n> This file can be completely empty, it just needs to be present for Figura to recognise it as an avatar\n\n### • How do I hide the vanilla model?\n> At the top of your script, put:\n>\n> • To hide literally everything (player, armor, elytra, held items):\n> ```lua\n> vanilla_model.ALL:setVisible(false)\n> ```\n>\n> • To hide only the player:\n> ```lua\n> vanilla_model.PLAYER:setVisible(false)\n> ```\n>\n> • To hide only armor:\n> ```lua\n> vanilla_model.ARMOR:setVisible(false)\n> ```\n> \n> • To hide other, or specific parts, you can check the in-game docs\n\n### • How do I play a Blockbench Animation?\n> Simply put this code in your script:\n> ```lua\n> animations.modelName.animationName:play()\n> ```\n> Where:\n> \n> \"`animations`\" is the global table which contains all animations\n> \n> \"`modelName`\" is the name of the model you are accessing the animation from\n> \n> \"`animationName`\" is, as the name says, the animation name\n\n### • What are Pings and how do I use them?\n> Pings are Lua functions that are executed for everyone running your avatar's script\n> \n> Pings are sent from the host player, and can be used to sync things like keypresses or action wheel actions\n> \n> To create a ping:\n> ```lua\n> function pings.myPing(arg1, arg2)\n>   -- code to run once the ping is called\n> end\n> ```\n> And to execute the ping, it's as simple as calling a lua function:\n> ```lua\n> pings.myPing(\"Hello\", \"World\")\n> ```\n> Note that pings are limited in their content and size, and are rate-limited\n\n### • How can I add an emissive texture?\n> Name the texture the same as the non-emissive counterpart, then add `_e` to the end\n> \n> And don't forget to set the places you don't want to glow to **transparent black** (#00000000), to also ensure compatibility with shader mods\n\n### • My emissives doesn't glow, nor have bloom with Iris/OptiFine shaders?\n> Since some shaders do not support emissives, a compatibility setting (default on) will change the render type of emissive textures to render them at it were fullbright, however that can lead to some unintended results\n>\n> You can force your avatar to use the correct emissive render type by using the render type `EYES` on your model\n\n### • How can I use Figura with OptiFine?\n> Figura will work with OptiFine but due to its closed source nature issues might arise, therefore we still recommend you try using Sodium+Iris (Fabric) or Rubidium+Oculus (Forge) instead\n> \n> Check out the full list of [alternatives](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/)\n\n### • Where can I find Avatars to download?\n> For now, you can find Avatars in the showcase channel in the official Discord server (A Web Based and In-Game browser is in the works!)\n\n### • My Minecraft is cracked (non-premium/non-original) or I'm trying to join a cracked offline mode server, why can't I use Figura?\n> Figura uses your account's UUID and your Mojang authentication as a way to prove you own that account, avoiding unwanted / malicious uploads\n> \n> Non-premium Minecraft accounts don't authenticate with Mojang, and Offline mode servers don't report working UUID's, as such can neither upload nor download Figura avatars\n\n\n## Community Resources\n\n* Want to learn / get into Lua scripting?\n  check out this [Lua quickstart](https://manuel-3.github.io/lua-quickstart) made by Manuel.\n\n* If you are tired of having to be in-game to look in the wiki, applejuice hosts the wiki as a [website.](https://applejuiceyy.github.io/figs/)\n\n* Are you new to Figura and are looking for a video tutorial about how everything works? You should probably watch Chloe's [Figura tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNz7v2g2SFA8lOQUDS4z4-gIDLi_dWAhl) on YouTube.\n\n* Do you use VSCode and wish Figura's documentation autocompleted in the editor? GrandpaScout saves the day with their [VSDocs.](https://github.com/GrandpaScout/FiguraRewriteVSDocs/wiki)\n\n* Katt has created a Blockbench extention which adds a special model format for Figura! Read more [here.](https://github.com/KitCat962/figura-format-bbplugin) - Note. This plugin is available on the Blockbench plugin browser and should be installed from there.\n\n* By searching \"Figura\" in the VSCode extention browser you can install Manuel's Figura [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Manuel-Underscore.figura)! It adds multiple useful features including autocomplete for your model paths.","published":"2023-07-15T16:18:01.628049Z","updated":"2023-08-11T18:44:03.586670Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":21030,"followers":247,"categories":["decoration","social","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["4IW3S96F","8892Wqoi","dZE1NNlF","Bdf9vHIF","68pcF68H","H6QWSHtz"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/s9gIPDom/9e3994b58a6a50d9143c0aa87df1c3b54e4b7919.png"},"version":{"id":"8892Wqoi","project_id":"s9gIPDom","author_id":"nsPUMXYd","featured":false,"name":"Figura 0.1.2+1.20.1","version_number":"0.1.2+1.20.1","changelog":"+ forge support\n+ optifine/optifabric compatibility\n+ animated emojis\n+ emojis can appear in more places in-game\n+ changed color scheme\n+ api fixes\n- removed herobrine","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-11T08:52:02.047006Z","downloads":13442,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"64c7757ca16cc41be6e5c2949991381b09e74c324975fe6371f74fb3e3fff4cf039c3f20f6171319499efbc34f5a15e6cb79bf51ea1a7f88fc1ddfa4280f757b","sha1":"9e72055d725cadaff98bbd21fca24ff149066a08"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/s9gIPDom/versions/8892Wqoi/figura-0.1.2%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"figura-0.1.2+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":4037906,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"PwB8lscg","user":{"id":"nsPUMXYd","username":"skyrina","name":"sky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116099351?v=4","bio":"lesbian.\r\nhttps://ko-fi.com/skyrina","created":"2023-07-15T13:49:13.372837Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"figura-0.1.2+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\valkyrienskies-1201-2.3.0-beta.4.jar":{"sha512":"b4df27042ec32c2f51893d839d58ec254bdd228b82486286e772d4eeacc6fed494955b66a4dc2ab0facd3f9dadf03c02f31075d396b81178e5efce7708fdcb81","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"V5ujR2yw","slug":"valkyrien-skies","project_type":"mod","team":"xtVZP6HK","title":"Valkyrien Skies","description":"Physics in Minecraft","body":"**Valkryien Skies 2 is in BETA.

Slicer\n\nThis mod enables a variety of features to create better compatibility between mostly [Farmer's Delight][FARMERS_DELIGHT_FORGE] and [Create][CREATE_FORGE].\nWhile it is designed to work with Farmer's Delight, it does work without it and also adds some compatibility features for other mods.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/slicer.png)\n\n### Automatic Cutting\n\nThe Main feature of the mod is the _Slicer_, a machine similar to the _Mechanical Mixer_ or _Mechanical Press_ from Create.\nIt automatically registers all cutting recipes from Farmer's Delight. In that sense, it is an automatic _Cutting Board_.  \nIn order to use it, the correct tool has to be placed into the machine, using `Right-Click`.\nBy default, only knives and axes are allowed, but this behaviour can be overwritten by modifying the `sliceanddice:allowed_tools` item tag.\nAn example datapack which adds shears to this tag can be found [here](https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/raw/1.20.x/example_datapack.zip)\n\n### Automatic Cooking\n\nAll recipes from Farmer's delight requiring the Cooking Pot are added as heated mixing recipes.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/cooking.png)\n\n### Sprinkler\n\nThe Sprinkler is a block which, when provided with a fluid using a pipe, will distribute it in a small area below.  \nDifferent fluids can have different effects.\n\n- Lava applies a small amount of fire damage to entities below\n- Water makes the area below wet, making the world think it's raining there.\n- Potions apply their affect for a short duration to entities below\n- Liquid Fertilizer, a new fluid, applies a bonemeal affect to blocks.\n\nThe latter is meant to enable growing of _Banana Fonds_ from [Neapolitan][NEAPOLITAN] without being dependent on the weather, but it could possibly have other effects on other mods

If one does not, feel free to report it.\n\n## Features\n\n#### Optimizations\n\nA lot of the optimizations in this mod are focused on getting rid of the majority of random lagspikes on servers.\\\nOther than that, it also includes plenty of optimizations for things like chunk ticking, mob spawning, item frames and\nplayer logins.\n\n##\n\n#### Entity Activation Range\n\nA very configurable feature that allows you to drastically cut down on the amount of entities that have to be processed\non the server.\\\nThis is a port based off of Spigot's and PaperMC's implementation, but more configurable with additional (optional) features.\n\n##\n\n#### Dynamic performance checks\n\nAllows the server to automatically adjust the current settings depending on the tick time and config.\\\nThese include: Chunk-tick distance, View distance, Simulation distance & Mobcaps.\n\n##\n\n#### Villager lobotomization\n\nAllows the server to cut down on villager lag from large trading halls, by making villagers stuck inside 1x1 spaces tick less often.\n\n##\n\n#### Breeding Caps\n\nA feature that allows you to set a cap on the amount of mobs of the same type that can be bred within a certain radius.\\\nThis can be useful to prevent players from breeding thousands of animals like chickens or cows in a small area.\n\n##\n\n#### Chunk ticking distance\n\nA setting that allows you to reduce the distance at which chunks can tick (mob spawns & random ticks).\n\\\n\\\n**- And more!**\n\n## Commands, Placeholders and Configuration\n\n### Commands\n<br>\n\n- /servercore settings | config - Allows for modifying settings & configs ingame.\n\n- /servercore status - Gives information about the current dynamic settings.\n\n- /mobcaps - Displays current per-player mobcaps for each spawn group.\n\n- /statistics entities | block-entities - Displays performance related statistics.\n\n##\n\n### Placeholders\n<br>\n\n- `%servercore:view_distance%` - The current view distance.\n- `%servercore:simulation_distance%` - The current simulation distance.\n- `%servercore:chunk_tick_distance%` - The current chunk tick distance.\n- `%servercore:mobcap_percentage%` - The global mobcap percentage that is currently being used.\n\n\n- `%servercore:chunk_count%` - The amount of chunks on the server (doesn't have to be fully loaded).\n- `%servercore:chunk_count loaded%` - The amount of fully loaded chunks on the server (expensive).\n\n\n- `%servercore:entity_count%` - The amount of loaded entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:entity_count nearby%` - The amount of loaded entities nearby.\n\n\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count%` - The amount of ticking block entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count nearby%` - The amount of ticking block entities nearby.\n\n##\n\n### Config\n\nMost features are disabled by default and can be found in the config.\\\nThe config file can be found at `/config/servercore.toml`\n\n```toml\n# Lets you enable /

Each feature can be toggled on or off to your liking, so you can customize your Minecraft experience just how you want it.\n\nMany features are perfect for multiplayer moments, like player sitting to make for your perfect player hangout, equipable head banners for your clans and factions, or player souls which store your items on death secured away from other players. Not only that but Vanilla Refresh has an easy installation that works with existing worlds.\n\n# Creative Mode Tools\n\nVanilla Refresh also comes with Creative Mode tools! Search the item menu through certain tagged items, which you can view them all by searching #vanilla_refresh: in the item search bar. You can also use wands, allowing you to instantly teleport yourself toward a selected location, instantly erase mobs, or clear surronding vegetation. Enter spectator mode and use a variety of actions, like teleporting to a random player or giving yourself night vision.\n\n\n# Settings / Commands\n\n**Toggle features in the settings menu by using `/function vanilla_refresh:_settings` in chat**\n\n**Access Creative Mode wands with `/function vanilla_refresh:_wands` in chat**\n\n**Access Creative Mode item sets with `/function vanilla_refresh:_item_sets` in chat**\n\nCertain Vanilla Refresh debug visuals and logs can be seen by running the command `/tag @s add refresh_debug`\n\n\n# Features:\n\nWith over 30+ features and still adding, Vanilla Refresh keeps making Minecraft that little bit better. Any features you don't like you can disable and re-enable at anytime via the settings menu\n\n \n<details>\n  <summary>Show Features</summary>\n\n### Enabled By Default:\n\n- Player Sitting: Sit anywhere by facing straight down, crouching and right clicking.

Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting.**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting system on client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will remain effective on client side only if given server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of my mod, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n \n## Installation and Use:\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric, just download the version for respective modloader. It can be installed on either client, server, or both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present at:\n\n**1. Only Client:** Client will refuse to send account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof they were actually sent from your account. Server will relay them unless `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to true in server options (which it is by default since 1.19.1), in which case you will not be able to join, unless you agree to send signed messages (the mod will supply warning screen);\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable player to system message conversion in config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signature will be stripped on client side before sending messages to server, server will make no attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough the mod can function when present on only one of the sides, it can be configured to demand itself to be installed on another side in order to play. This way you can install it on server and require all clients that join to have this mod in order to have full functionality, but can also leave it server-only if you prefer. Configuration files are located in <u>NoChatReports</u> subfolder of default config folder.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on client, this mod will disable telemetry (similarly to how [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make Velocity compatible with this mod, set `force-key-authentication = false` in `velocity.toml`. Thanks to [MrMelon54](https://github.com/MrMelon54) for pointing this out.\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to chat encryption, you can watch it to learn how to use it (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make No Chat Reports on client recognize servers with your software as safe. I wrote [a small article about this](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status). For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

Tweaks","description":"Enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons. ","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2023-10-01T09:40:10.683782Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":515666,"followers":1209,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","b1.7.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"stb5nE30","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20–1.20.1 Forge] Mouse Tweaks 2.25","version_number":"1.20-2.25-forge","changelog":"- Updated to Minecraft 1.20.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-11T22:36:15.075064Z","downloads":52500,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"f3e8805d706a36717306d92bd5c45cb2aef854b6","sha512":"487206c6116aa742d3c9fe638f4388c0b82e2837e25552faec21d2abf960f95a46a0132b704bb46b78e559ab42e8512b50719311b37bd2c6b3c4764869eb1f07"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/stb5nE30/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25.jar","primary":true,"size":76146,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"e2b99d4ce7cfc48b457ececbdf8f895980b3f071567b1940b048ca3a8eded1df86f713cdf7a3c2fe85ec2eec9c42a41bc2650a66fe63a099dcece3935a8c144a","sha1":"b11c08657d0daa8de55ed950bb10f320113fa017"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/stb5nE30/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25-api.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25-api.jar","primary":false,"size":1995,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"6cf2985e3f034ce0472f6ab2ac4877e4c248a53a","sha512":"a6dbe724e2f159e05a9b1e4b7a55081d884b4dfc4054bfe3ff70dcd8787b60eda717282913255d00bbb7e0855f436b8656ccd69f600aa8b7787e1ea1d4ce7fe1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/stb5nE30/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25-src.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25-src.jar","primary":false,"size":19690,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20-2.25.jar"},"mods\\xercamusic-1.20.1-1.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"3eab6615606f0af55169d7639278ab5521034cde1c054abe3a0f828488b16050fb2032aab301dad2681896c7562681a0dccb914bf88e866d7a1a0d0a93c02499","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"qQpWCN75","slug":"music-maker-mod","project_type":"mod","team":"hz9BWPt7","title":"Music Maker Mod","description":"Music Maker Mod adds music sheets, instruments and other devices to the game for creating and playing music.","body":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Music Maker Mod adds music sheets, instruments and other devices to the game for creating and playing music.

Here is a quick look through the changes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overhauled the music sheet GUI. Now it is a horizontal, scrolling sheet.</li>\n<li>You can now create <strong>MUCH longer</strong> music sheets. The upper limit is long enough to fit basically any music in a single sheet.</li>\n<li><strong>Note length</strong> is customizable! You can drag the mouse to set the length of each note.</li>\n<li>Multiple notes can be put at the same beat, and notes of different lengths can <strong>overlap</strong> in any way possible!</li>\n<li>TWICE the number of octaves. So, we are up from 4 to <strong>8 octaves</strong>. Note that not every instrument is suitable for every octave.</li>\n<li>Music sheets have a <strong>volume</strong> setting now.</li>\n<li>Each individual note also has a <strong>volume</strong> that can be set.</li>\n<li>Much more<strong> granular Tempo options</strong>, with an upper limit of 3000 BPM!</li>\n<li><strong>4</strong> <strong>new instruments</strong>: Redstone Guitar, Bass Guitar, Oboe and French Horn</li>\n<li>Advanced instrument playing GUI: You can now press <strong>multiple notes together</strong>, and <strong>releasing a key stops the note</strong>.</li>\n<li>Support for <strong>MIDI device input</strong> in the instrument GUI!

The ticking rate can be set with a right click or using a music sheet on the metronome.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;After four tickings of a metronome, all nearby players that hold a music sheet with the correct tempo and an instrument will start playing synchronously. Use this to play songs together with your band.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Keyboard usage is as shown:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/VvVz169/music-mod-keyboard.png\" alt=\"Keyboard Bindings\" width=\"480\" height=\"188\" />&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crafting Recipes</h2>\n<h4><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/09rkM0z/music-recipes.png\" width=\"730\" height=\"818\" /></h4>\n<h4>Credits</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>LuchadorMickey</strong> for most of the graphics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>inuyasha01</strong> for the Chinese translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>Greyberet</strong> for the Spanish translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>Ste B </strong>for the Italian translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <span class=\"opened-by\"><strong>whiteevilbro</strong></span> for the Russian translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>Szpieg2000</strong> for the Polish translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>FoxMcloud5655</strong> for back-porting changes to 1.16.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Community</h4>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://discord.gg/kAXdzKGXtW\">Discord server</a> now, where you can share your creations with the world!</p>\n<div style=\"all: initial !important;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"all: initial !important;\">&nbsp;</div>","published":"2023-02-05T14:15:40.306769Z","updated":"2023-12-03T17:54:59.508576Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":23172,"followers":78,"categories":["decoration","game-mechanics","social"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["5xGpUT3o","VFv617TS","c62RBvbc","v4i8vz6N","vFsY5EDb","He8qxPaP","sH524ipB","1eMIAl3g","6WneoHVZ","Uu63sYWg","XT3XLTcW","Mt13SJH7","y5ILp4Ep","HshJamuy","E5VM3nf1","Kzq2EOKC","atsAXaFx","WeiESc7B","9ceNeRjO","vAdwlMhE","GAtc1v9U","lns17YWi","L9GiipeN","vkIE67gD","uzfwjdqC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qQpWCN75/5651c74521ed00c9d586f81f81cdecb099307291.png"},"version":{"id":"vkIE67gD","project_id":"qQpWCN75","author_id":"tIBCPzSw","featured":true,"name":"Music Maker Mod 1.20.1-1.0.1","version_number":"1.20.1-1.0.1","changelog":"Fixed a bug with breaking empty music boxes.

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it.

Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it.

Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2023-12-07T20:45:51.967907Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":1343876,"followers":1733,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.19.4-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","22w42a","23w05a","23w06a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU","vede4iWJ","n8X2J9Hh","ZytICJS4","IHHNzQkV","3TfeWIWo","cwavYrLH","vMzBhYIk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"smEdHeFU","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"3.2.1+1.20 (Forge)","version_number":"3.2.1+1.20-forge","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.2.1 for 1.20.1-0\n\n## Changes\n\n### Config API\n\n- Added `ConfigClassHandler#save` and `ConfigClassHandler#load` and deprecated `ConfigClassHandler#serializer`.\n  - The serializer should now never be called directly.\n  - New load method tells serializer to load into a new instance of the config class.

Installing it on a server won't do anything.**\n\nThis mod allows you to type some emoji/symbols more easily in Minecraft. To be clear, this mod (technically) does not add any emoji to the game, it only makes typing the ones _already in the game_ easier. For this reason, emoji typed will be visible to anyone else on a server and will still be there (on signs, books, etc) if you uninstall the mod. I can not absolutely guarantee all symbols/emoji will work on all servers, some servers have plugins that mess with chat and there is really nothing I can do about that.\n\n### Typing Emojis\nTo type an emoji in chat, simply type a \":\" (colon), after that a list of all possible emoji keywords will appear. Once you type a keyword it will be replaced with the corresponding emoji or symbol. If you want to type an emoji outside of chat (anvil, sign, etc) the list won't appear but the keywords all still work.\n\n### Gallery\n<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emoji-type/gallery\">**Images of example mod usage**</a>\n\n### 2.0.0 Update\n- The mod is now fully configurable through Mod Menu and Cloth Config. That means you can add your own emoticons and symbols if you want to!\n- Longer strings are now supported!

compatibilities have been moved into an addon mod: [InvMoveCompats](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMoveCompats)<br>\n\n![demo.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/media/demo.gif)\n\nEnables moving, jumping, sprinting, etc. from within inventories.\n\nAlso hides the darkened background tint in inventories that don't pause the game.\n\nBoth features can be toggled on or off per-inventory in the config menu.\n\nThis mod is client-side, but it may raise alarms if used on servers with anticheat.<br>\nI take no responsibility if you get banned or something because you used this on public servers.\n\n### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/releases)\n\nRequires [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) on Forge/Fabric/Quilt.<br>\nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) on Fabric.<br>\nRequires [Quilted Fabric API / Quilt Standard Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) on Quilt.<br>\nFor Fabric, you need [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to be able to open the config screen.<br>\nFor Forge, I also recommend [Game Menu Mod Option](https://modrinth.com/mod/gamemenumodoption) so you can change settings in-game.\n\n## Config (In-game)\n\n#### General:\n- Enable Mod: Enable the entire mod\n- Debug Display: Enables a debug overlay that can help debug compatibility problems.\n\n#### UI Movement:\n- Move In Inventories: Enable movement in inventories<br>\n  There is a keybind you can set to toggle this setting (unbound by default)\n- Allow Jumping: Allow jumping in inventories\n- Sneak Mode: How to handle sneaking in inventories:\n  - Off = No sneaking\n  - Maintain = Keep sneaking if you were when the inventory opened (default)\n  - Pressed = Sneak only while holding the sneak button (can be distracting when shift-clicking)\n- Allow Dismounting: Allow dismounting from mounts in inventories (overrides \"Sneak Mode\" while on a mount)\n- Text Field Disables Movement: Disable movement when a text field is focused (like search bars or in an anvil)\n\n#### UI Background:\n- Hide Inventory Backgrounds: Hides the background tint while in inventories.\n- Pause Screens Background: How to handle screens that pause the game:\n  - Show = Always show background\n  - ShowSP = Show background in singleplayer, otherwise allow hide\n  - AllowHide = Allow background to be hidden\n\nThe Movement and Background pages also have expandable categories containing toggles for individual inventory types.<br>\nThe base mod only has a category for vanilla inventories. For more mod compatibilities, see [InvMoveCompats](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMoveCompats)<br>\nAny screens not handled by installed mod compatibilities are added to the \"Unrecognized UI Types\" section, grouped by modid.\n\n## Usage\n\nFeel free to use in packs if you wish.\n\nThe only official downloads are from the InvMove GitHub, Modrinth, or CurseForge page.<br>\nBe careful downloading them from elsewhere, as unauthorized reposts are not monitored and could contain malware.<br>\n(If you are interested in the mod being added to another platform, please open an issue!)\n\nThe mod is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/blob/master/COPYING)","published":"2022-02-20T20:50:17.872579Z","updated":"2023-06-18T23:58:21.059467Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":317953,"followers":761,"categories":["transportation","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["g6dHjPlj","Nw08AijY","zSjRFisS","KlCCrdyH","z1wUcYrz","Rowb4urF","FxtmKzFE","nyLttvyA","2PM0Ne3I","mXm80CHn","nc2YXBFR","ZUUyXFpC","KZODMPL5","YglVnx4G","AvfVeby1","aarEmm3o","VgnPhVTW","Clo0PUhb","FlJXgCDA","ODrlrF3Z","whx4cyXm","DjMssqvc","FJ91FXja","O575lNuT","dGo1L388","2tK5XdF0","um5St4s3","u2qv60JQ","sVkuPH9Y","qTu058ya","gn5FSncy","sWRkeaiE","LG7n0kA8","RKDVymOM","UTuW1mu8","RsLNtqpA","H2moqgPv","kzI0tILB","2sYsuomN","1uJ8OF0p","Q59zS7Fb","NudOSeIR","L9gZxJNb","VE4bOg3y","WzbaGwer","pfLgaUxC","hrMnbArx","920571eR","h6ELnOF4","JxGn75dh","vk2Y8XQV","WIXovitR","AE0sDDm3","W5h8ZaUy","kqq0UN1u","6CNOChud"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/REfW2AEX/7c10ef4460c5b2998dac53a494ec9051851f0e76.png"},"version":{"id":"6CNOChud","project_id":"REfW2AEX","author_id":"U9xrZlQH","featured":false,"name":"v0.8.4 (1.20)","version_number":"1.20-0.8.4-forge","changelog":"(note: marked as alpha because I did not have time to test every version/loader)\n<br>- Update for 1.20\n<br>- Workaround for issues with certain freecam mods ([gh-19](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/issues/19))","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-18T23:58:21.898641Z","downloads":27465,"version_type":"alpha","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"f7d7a683c2e4899d013c207c1f11bee7f1f3354e47345972d9e3f60dcab411255755720520496c72ef79469ed2e07cf61a2890f686b70e055119fd4b119608e7","sha1":"5a68c14eca94747c78b4492c781612d17b450c05"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/REfW2AEX/versions/6CNOChud/InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Forge.jar","filename":"InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Forge.jar","primary":true,"size":125604,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"JoLgnJ0G","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"1rXrl5vy","user":{"id":"U9xrZlQH","username":"PieKing1215","name":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13819558?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-05-27T06:09:15.544829Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Forge.jar.disabled"},"mods\\JeiTweaker-forge-1.20.1-8.0.6.jar":{"sha512":"955e8b8a30bffc25dd78537e6330010fffc43815614caa5f8d33d5dd8a61343be9aaab5b364cc1ff28dd6015ebe79150e630e8db24a52b2f308b4c9d540283be","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"EiEOyeoL","slug":"jeitweaker","project_type":"mod","team":"rsx9pRez","title":"JEITweaker","description":"Adds CraftTweaker support to Just Enough Items","body":"<p>This mod adds CraftTweaker support for Just Enough Items, such as the ability to hide items, hide categories and add JEI descriptions items.</p>\n<p>This used to be a part of CraftTweaker itself, but since CraftTweaker was rewritten for 1.14, the mod support is being pulled out into it's own mod.</p>\n\n<p>Documentation for the mod is available on the <a href=\"https://docs.blamejared.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CraftTweaker Docs</a>!</p>\n\n\n<h2>If you need any help, you should checkout our discord over here: <a href=\"https://discord.blamejared.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></h2>\n\nIf you would like to support me in my modding endeavors, you can become a patron via **[![Patreon logo](https://i.imgur.com/CAJuExT.png) Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jaredlll08)**.\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/jared.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/jared)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-12-13T09:52:16.752416Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2163479,"followers":4100,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"DG5Fn9Sz","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1

Or if you prefer a more direct guide, [click here!](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight is currently being updated for 1.18.2 and 1.19+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No, this mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\n**Please do NOT ask for backports!**\n\n**Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?**\n\nA. Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time.

With this mod, players no longer have to manually update each mod or the entire modpack. The tedious task of updating is handled automatically, making the experience more seamless and enjoyable.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lPPzaNPn8g8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nI do not take credit for any of the content that can be downloaded from the mod. Likely all materials, except for the mod itself, were created by various talented individuals!\n\n## Key features\n- Auto modpack updating for seamless player experience.\n- Effortless modpack management for admins, including the ability to easily manage mods, configs, resource packs, and more.\n- Direct downloads from modrinth and curseforge.\n- Dynamic modpack updates without disrupting player experience.\n- Quick and simple installation process.\n\n## How it works?\nOn server AutoModpack generates a file called modpack-content.json on the server, which contains all the mods, configs, resource packs, and other necessary files for your modpack. The server also hosts this file, as well as all the files contained within it, on an HTTP server.\n\nWhen a client joins the server, the modpack automatically downloads the modpack-content.json file from HTTP server, check modrinth and curseforge APIs to get direct downloads of as most as possible files and then it downloads all the files contained within modpack-content, if they haven't been installed before on client. The client simply needs to wait a few seconds for the files to download, install, and restart the game. Once the process is complete, the client can join the server again and enjoy the modpack\n\n## Is it secure?\n\nSimply, no. This mod allows ANY server running it to put ANY file in your game folder, such as a virus or a keylogger. So if you are a client please make sure you trust your server administrator and as a good measure make sure to scan your games folders for malicious content. Please direct any useful security material to the github issues. However as long you know server is safe and owner isn't impostor, you should be good.\n\nThis is only intended for personal use.

Join the server. Now modpack will be magically downloaded and installed. You will only need to click few buttons to confirm download and restart the game.\n2. Join the server again and Enjoy!\n\n**- Server**\n\n1. Open/Forward port (default: `30037` on TCP protocol) on your server! need to host modpack. (Port needs to be different from port used by minecraft server)\n2. Restart server\n\nand you are good to go!\n\nDoesn't work? Check minecraft server logs!\n\n#### Do you want to add more content to your modpack?\n- By default, the modpack will automatically synchronize all mods, configs from default server directories to the modpack. (Check `syncedFiles` list in `/automodpack/automodpack-server.json`)\n- To add more mods to your server, place them in the `/automodpack/host-modpack/mods/` directory.\n  And so analogically to add shaderpacks, put them in `/automodpack/host-modpack/shaderpacks/`. You can create any subdirectories you need within `/automodpack/host-modpack/` folder.\n- Or add whatever file/folder from server main directory to the `syncedFiles` list in `/automodpack/automodpack-server.json`\n\n#### Do you want to delete some mods from modpack?\n- Just delete what file you want to delete from directory on your server.\n- Or check and delete whatever file/folder from list `syncedFiles` in `/automodpack/automodpack-server.json`\n\n#### Do you want to exclude some mods from `syncedFiles`?\n- Just add them to the `excludeSyncedFiles` list in `/automodpack/automodpack-server.json`\n\n\n## Config\n\n*/automodpack/automodpack-server.json*\n\n| Name                        | Default Value                                                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `modpackName`               |                                                                                                         | The name of the server modpack, shows while downloading modpack, more in the near future!                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| `modpackHost`               | `true`                                                                                                  | Starts HTTP server to host modpack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| `generateModpackOnStart`    | `true`                                                                                                  | Automatically generate modpack when the server starts.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| `syncedFiles`               | `\"/mods/\", \"/config/\"`                                                                                  | A list of files and directories that will be synced from the default server directory to the modpack.                                                                                                                                                             |\n| `excludeSyncedFiles`        | `\"/mods/iDontWantThisModInModpack.jar\", \"/config/andThisConfigToo.json\", \"/mods/andAllTheseMods-*.jar\"` | A list of *only* files that will be excluded from the syncing process.

Configure the options, keybinds and server list as you would like them to be shipped in the modpack\n2. Join any world and run \"/defaultoptions saveAll\" to save your current options in the defaultoptions folder (located in the config folder where it should remain)\n3. Do not include the options.txt and servers.dat from the root directory in your modpack\n4. Fresh installations (meaning no existing options.txt) will now start out with your default options\n\n**If you are using FoamFix Anarchy Version**, disable `B:initOptions` in the FoamFix config or else Default Options will not work.

There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-13T21:48:54.507121Z","updated":"2023-12-08T18:45:45.608403Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":301417,"followers":1140,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["Q9qUUqA7","Wd3Co0mZ","81tshMIZ","Xf5mFGCS","jUK1mCz3","1latp88m","pNFzTzQd","mLdNNka6","K3S6BASh","aYOzrVFZ","Y4i2gvLB","D0hKeWDQ","JT2esX5R","8N8lLvTW","34PhE3zd","2w1uZoRC","PNByHzei","WZvndtxX","UJtMNPNx","Rq2BBA8A","hYoo0DKV","CDrDiFNK","qFd4s3fV","FOe2l0tx","IWVbiEbl","1hOeraaL","4KrRTVvQ","WgDuoe1K","xm11wemG","FgvUosFH","zA1qYB0L","6DoFR4md"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/34c751cc804839ed3c1d9f21dfd53d98368fedfc.png"},"version":{"id":"FgvUosFH","project_id":"8oi3bsk5","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v2.4.11 ~ 1.20.2","version_number":"2.4.11","changelog":"This is for ALL modloaders 1.20-1.20.2.\n\n# Terralith 2.4.11\n- Emergency hotfix: prevent crash regarding \"regular structure set\"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-08T01:10:08.715317Z","downloads":11772,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"b6bd6e71666dd57e1db19fe7cad85a9e0d9a13a9c6fa839c4e9cb149b12cf855f8f1676c4bc4d9647f1ba32a7a4f40d3f7090de3c5ddd569950c408b8cfd9128","sha1":"ac529b2a6ab9189cc6b6b459fa7b7b85f6e230e4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/versions/FgvUosFH/Terralith_1.20.4_v2.4.11.jar","filename":"Terralith_1.20.4_v2.4.11.jar","primary":true,"size":2478785,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"L2q5L80c","user":{"id":"oRXQvVNJ","username":"Stardust","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/oRXQvVNJ/97f7c767b3b6c78eafb51a2e17f04b36da5d294d.jpeg","bio":null,"created":"2022-11-13T21:48:01.983224Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"L2q5L80c","user":{"id":"SR8MIsEo","username":"catter1","name":"catter1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63272345?v=4","bio":"Technical Lead for Stardust Labs.

A fork of the much-beloved [ComputerCraft], it continues its legacy with improved performance and stability, along with a wealth of new features.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n> I'm not sure what that is [...] I don't know where that came from.\n>\n> \\- [direwolf20, December 2020](https://youtu.be/D8Ue9I-SKeM?t=980)\n\n> It is basically ComputerCraft. It has the turtles, and the computers, and writing Lua programs and all that stuff.\n>\n> \\- [direwolf20, May 2022](https://youtu.be/7Ruq33XmQIQ?t=537)\n\n\n## Features\nControlled using the [Lua programming language][lua], CC: Tweaked's computers provides all the tools you need to start\nwriting code and automating your Minecraft world.\n\n![A ComputerCraft terminal open and ready to be programmed.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/basic-terminal.png)\n\nWhile computers are incredibly powerful, they're rather limited by their inability to move about. *Turtles* are the\nsolution here. They can move about the world, placing and breaking blocks, swinging a sword to protect you from zombies,\nor whatever else you program them to!\n\n![A turtle tunneling in Minecraft.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/turtle.png)\n\nNot all problems can be solved with a pickaxe though, and so CC: Tweaked also provides a bunch of additional peripherals\nfor your computers. You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your\ncomputers together with modems, and much more.\n\nComputers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item\nmanagement systems.\n\n![A chest's contents being read by a computer and displayed on a monitor.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/peripherals.png)\n\n## Getting Started\nWhile ComputerCraft is lovely for both experienced programmers and for people who have never coded before, it can be a\nlittle daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:\n\n - [Direwolf20's ComputerCraft tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUHUhfCY5A \"ComputerCraft Tutorial Episode 1 - HELP! and Hello World\")\n - [Sethbling's ComputerCraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSsx4VSe-Uk \"Programming Tutorial with Minecraft Turtles -- Ep. 1: Intro to Turtles and If-Then-Else_End\")\n - [Lyqyd's Computer Basics 1](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/15033-computer-basics-i/ \"Computer Basics I\")\n\nOnce you're a little more familiar with the mod, the [wiki](https://tweaked.cc/) provides more detailed documentation on the\nvarious APIs and peripherals provided by the mod.\n\nIf you get stuck, do [ask a question on GitHub][GitHub Discussions] or pop in to the ComputerCraft's [IRC channel][IRC].\n\n## Get Involved\nCC: Tweaked lives on [GitHub].

Crafting recipes are given below.</li>\n<li>When crafting a palette, any combination of dyes will do, but you need at least one dye.</li>\n<li>You can then fill the palette with other dyes if you want.</li>\n<li>There are currently four kinds of canvases. The basic one is 1 block sized. The others are 1x2, 2x1 and 2x2 block sized.</li>\n<li>Using a canvas (by itself) with right-click lets you view its content.</li>\n<li>Using a palette (by itself) lets you open the palette interface, where you can mix colors to create custom ones.</li>\n<li>Using a canvas in one hand and a palette on the other lets you open both interfaces at once, where you can paint on the canvas using the colors on your palette. You can mix colors here as well.</li>\n<li>Another option is to place the canvas on an easel and right click the easel with a palette at hand.</li>\n<li>The color mixing rules work the same way as the vanilla leather armor dyeing mechanic.</li>\n<li>Change the brush size or opacity with the mouse wheel or by clicking on the GUI element</li>\n<li>Undo mistakes with the CTRL+Z shortcut</li>\n<li>After painting a canvas, you can use it on a wall similar to vanilla paintings to hang it on the wall.</li>\n<li>Hitting the hanged canvas or breaking a block it rests on will drop it back as an item.</li>\n<li>Sign a painting to give it a name and make it unchangeable.</li>\n<li>Copy signed paintings by crafting them together with an empty canvas of the same shape.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crafting Recipes</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Vpf9MsM/canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"159\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7rwQHrr/long-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting long canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"142\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/dByhxvw/tall-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting tall canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"145\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/26jnbYv/large-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a large canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"134\" /></p>\n<p>To craft a palette, you need at least one kind of dye:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7Xy8959/palette-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a palette\" width=\"400\" height=\"134\" /></p>\n<p>You can fill an existing palette with other dyes later:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/L8V5BsS/palette-fill.png\" alt=\"Filling a palette\" width=\"400\" height=\"132\" /></p>\n<p>You can copy signed paintings:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/PW9LKrG/copying-recipe.png\" alt=\"Copying a signed painting\" width=\"400\" height=\"132\" /></p>\n<h5>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Crafting an easel:</span></h5>\n<h5><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/jWg0Xkx/java-zva-Bwzjr8-A.png\" alt=\"Easel recipe\" width=\"400\" height=\"178\" /></h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Community</h4>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://discord.gg/kAXdzKGXtW\">Discord server</a> now, where you can share your creations with the world!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>About shaders:</h4>\n<p>The latest versions (1.18.2, 1.19.2 and above) seem to work fine with custom shaders, but there is no guarantee that it will work with every shader.
